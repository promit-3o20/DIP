# Digital Image Processing (DIP)

## Overview

Digital Image Processing (DIP) is a field of study that involves the manipulation and analysis of digital images using various techniques and algorithms. This GitHub repository provides a collection of tools, algorithms, and examples related to digital image processing.

## Features

- **Image Enhancement:** Apply filters and transformations to improve the quality of images.
- **Image Restoration:** Restore degraded or corrupted images using advanced algorithms.
- **Image Segmentation:** Divide an image into meaningful regions for analysis and interpretation.
- **Object Recognition:** Identify and classify objects within images using pattern recognition techniques.
- **Image Compression:** Reduce the size of images while preserving important information.
- **Computer Vision:** Explore applications of digital image processing in computer vision tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/promit-3o20/DIP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd DIP
   ```

3. Explore the folders and find examples, algorithms, and tools for various image processing tasks.

## Examples

### Image Enhancement

```python
from image_processing import enhance_image

# Load an image
image = load_image("path/to/image.jpg")

# Apply enhancement
enhanced_image = enhance_image(image)

# Display the results
show_images([image, enhanced_image], ["Original Image", "Enhanced Image"])
```

### Image Segmentation

```python
from image_processing import segment_image

# Load an image
image = load_image("path/to/image.jpg")

# Perform segmentation
segmented_image = segment_image(image)

# Display the results
show_images([image, segmented_image], ["Original Image", "Segmented Image"])
```
